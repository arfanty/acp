		Dear Professor Poon,
		  <p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Thank you for your interest in attending the <b>Asia Communications and Photonics Conference (ACP)</b>, which will be held 11-14 November 2014 in Shanghai, China at the Shanghai International Convention Center.  The meeting is open to all Optical Society of America (OSA), Society of Photographic Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE), IEEE Photonics Society, IEEE Communications Society, Chinese Optical Society (COS), China Institute of Communications (CIC) members, and those with related optics interest.</p>
		  <p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp This letter serves as a formal invitation for you to participate in the meeting.  Your participation in the meeting includes presenting your paper, attending sessions in your area of interest, and an opportunity to communicate with others working in the field of optical science.</p>
		  <p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp This is an invitation to participate in the meeting but not a personal sponsorship of your stay in China.  You will need to secure your own funding for travel, registration, and housing expenses for the meeting.</p>
		  <p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Additional meeting information, including visa requirements, is available on the ACP website at www.acp-conf.org.  Thank you for your interest in the meeting and we look forward to seeing you in Shanghai.</p>

		Sincerely,<br>
		<br>
